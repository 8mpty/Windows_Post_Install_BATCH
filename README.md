## Additional Options (Disclaimers)

~~Ofcourse these options are not only limited to Options 5 & 6, other options are availble to try but do **NOTE** that only a max of "2" options are availble.~~

~~As of right now, this script is not able to run further than "2" arguments like ```iex "&{$(irm post.8mpty.xyz)} 5 3 1"```.~~

~~Above is meant to go to the [Extras] Page and execute option [3] which is "Removal of Folders" and will execute [1] to confirm the removal but as of this current iteration of the script, it is **NOT POSSIBLE** yet.~~

The script is now able to run unlimited arguments as long as the arguments corresponds to the correct options in the script.
